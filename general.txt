Welcome to general!
Wallaby3: Ms Pac Man is exactly like Pac-Man but sped up about 100%. There are new fuits and Pac-Man has a bow. Otherwise, the same.
KanyeReeves: Sounds interesting, and hard
giant_ian: Fully on board with this analysis, it's certainly more fun to play as a non-skilled Pac-Man player ğŸ™‚ 
(first time I ever played this was at a gamer bar just off the old strip in Las Vegas with <@!318204205435322368>, so maybe I'm remembering with "beer"-tinted glasses :P)
giant_ian: Not sure if the ghost AI is as complicated/varied. Not sure, never looked into it, just thought it was more fun ğŸ™‚
KanyeReeves: Hey, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!
giantlindsay: Ah that vegas trip ^_^
